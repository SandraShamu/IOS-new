<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY. THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN LOLLIPOP AND YOU WHICH GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF AND AGREEMENT TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND YOUR REPRESENTATION THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. IF YOU OBJECT TO ANYTHING IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU ARE NOT PERMITTED TO USE THE SERVICES. </p> <br><br>
<p>If you are accepting these Terms of Service and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant to Lollipop that you have full power and authority to do so.  </p> <br><br>
<p>The Services are protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of the Services, or any portion of them, may result in severe civil and criminal penalties, and will be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible under the law. The Services are licensed, not sold. </p> <br><br>
<p>The Lollipop Services
Lollipop is a platform that connects salons, merchants, stylists and professionals (collectively or individually, "Professionals") providing hair, beauty and other health and wellness services ("Styling Services") with clients seeking such services ("Clients" or "you"). The Professionals and Clients are both users of the Services provided by Lollipop and are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Users." </p> <br><br>
<p>Lollipop solely provides a platform for Professionals and Clients to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision of Styling Services. Lollipop does not provide or contract for Styling Services, and Professionals and Clients contract independently for the provision of Styling Services. Each Client is solely responsible for selecting the Professional, the Styling Services to be provided and the location at which Styling Services will be performed, whether on the premises of a Professional or at a site designated by the Client. Any decision by a Client to receive Styling Services or by a Professional to provide Styling Services is a decision made in such person's sole discretion and at their own risk. All Users understand and acknowledge that (i) the Company does not conduct background checks on Clients and (ii) any provision of Services in a private location inherently increases the risks involved for both Clients and Professionals.  </p> <br><br>
<p>Lollipop does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Styling Services provided by Professionals nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Professionals or Clients. Lollipop makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to Styling Services offered or provided by Professionals or requested by Clients through use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the accreditation, registration or licensing of any Professional. You understand that Lollipop does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the background of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. Lollipop does not verify or confirm that any User is who they claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with respect to Styling Services on the Services. Lollipop does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Lollipop may, but is not obligated to, check the background and experience of Professionals via third-party background check services and first party interviews, including but not limited to a verification of identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, and may terminate a Professional based on any information discovered during such background checks and first party interviews. Whether or not Lollipop conducts a background check or first party interview on a Professional, each Client must decide whether a Professional is suited to such Client's needs and should exercise caution and common sense to protect their personal safety and property, just as they would when interacting with anyone you don't know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICES AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO.  COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. </p> <br><br>
<p>In connection with certain services, including Styling Services, for which reservations are made available on the Services, some Professionals may require you to enter credit card or other payment information, and such Professionals may charge fees for reservations, including cancelled and missed appointments. The Professionals are only allowed to do so in accordance with any policy posted on such Professional's Lollipop page at the time of your booking. By entering your payment information when requested, you authorize Lollipop and its payment processors to charge and process the fees and charges assessed in connection with your reservations in accordance with the policy described on the Professional's Lollipop page at the time of your booking. While Lollipop takes what it believes to be reasonable efforts to ensure secure transmission of your information to third parties who assess and process payments, Lollipop is not responsible for any fees or charges assessed by third parties or any errors in the processing of payments by third parties, including any errors that result from third-party negligence, improper transmission of payment information, your mistaken submission of payment information, or your submission of erroneous payment information. </p> <br><br>
<p>If you cancel or don't show up for an appointment, your credit card may still be charged in accordance with the cancellation policy of the Professional posted on such Professional's Lollipop page at the time of your booking, at the Professional's discretion.  Lollipop facilitates the payment transaction per these Terms between you and each Professional, but is not responsible for mediating any resulting disputes.  Lollipop has no obligation to provide refunds or credits, but may grant them in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific refund guarantee promotions, or to correct any errors made by Lollipop, in each case in Lollipop's sole discretion. </p> <br><br>
<p>Although the Services are intended to provide a Professional's availability in real-time, it is possible that a scheduling conflict may occur that requires the Professional to reschedule your reservation. Creation of a reservation using the Services is not a guarantee that the Professional will honor the reservation as scheduled. </p> <br><br>
<p>Lollipop cannot guarantee availability of the Services to any User. </p> <br><br><p>
